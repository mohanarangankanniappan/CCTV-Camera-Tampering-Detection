# CCTV-Camera-Tampering-Detection
Designed and implemented real-time detection algorithms to identify tampering events such as occlusion, defocus, displacement, and scene changes. The approach involved statistical analysis, frequency domain techniques, edge map entropy, and frame differencing to reliably trigger alerts and maintain surveillance integrity.
